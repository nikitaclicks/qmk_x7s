# X.Tips X7S / IQX7S / XTips X7 Mechanical Keyboard with QMK and VIAL Support

The keyboard works out of the box with **VIA** using the `via-x7.json` file. The QMK files in this repository were provided by the vendor, and you can use them to customize the keyboard via **QMK**.

You can also use **VIAL** to easily reflash and configure the keyboard without recompiling the firmware, while taking advantage of features like tap dance, chords, auto-shift, and other QMK functionalities.

### How to Enter Bootloader Mode:
To enter bootloader mode and flash new firmware, you can bind the `RESET` button via the **VIA GUI**.

### How to Use VIAL:
I followed the steps in this [video](https://youtu.be/O8pdUPqPG3k), and everything worked fine for me. I maintain a `vial` subdirectory for [vial-qmk](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk).
